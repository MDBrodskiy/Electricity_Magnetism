\begin{enumerate}

  \item Six charges are arranged along the sides and corners of a square with sides of length L as shown. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the electric field at the origin. Use symmetry and superposition to make the calculation simple.

      \begin{figure}[h]

        \label{fig:1}
      \end{figure}
    \end{center}

    We know, by definition, that $\vec{F}=\vec{E}q$. Using the concepts we know about force, we know the following charges cancel out each other, as they are symmetric about the test charge at the origin:

      \caption{The Opposite Forces Negate Each Other}
      \label{fig:4}
    \end{figure}

    Thus, we need only consider the effects of these charges:

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \include{Figures/Figure2-3.tex}
      \caption{These Charges Remain Relevant}
      \label{fig:5}
    \end{figure}

    Using superposition, we know that the two charges can be summed, and they produce a force equal to $-3q$ at an angle of $\frac{\pi}{4}$ radians with respect to the $x$-axis. Decomposing this, we know the force can be expressed, with $Q$ as the test charge, as:

    $$F_Q=\frac{(Q)(-3q)}{4\pi\varepsilon_o R^2}\cos\left( \frac{\pi}{4} \right)\bold{\hat{x}}+\frac{(Q)(-3q)}{4\pi\varepsilon_o R^2}\sin\left( \frac{\pi}{4} \right)\bold{\hat{y}}$$

    To find the electric field, we can simply divide by the test charge:

    $$E_Q=-\frac{3q}{4\pi\varepsilon_o R^2}\cos\left( \frac{\pi}{4} \right)\bold{\hat{x}}-\frac{3q}{4\pi\varepsilon_o R^2}\sin\left( \frac{\pi}{4} \right)\bold{\hat{y}}$$

    Additionally, we know that $R=\sqrt{\left( \frac{L}{2} \right)^2+\left( \frac{L}{2} \right)^2}=\sqrt{\frac{L^2}{2}}=\frac{L}{\sqrt{2}}$. This gives us:

    $$\boxed{E_Q=-\frac{3\sqrt{2}q}{4\pi\varepsilon_o L^2}\bold{\hat{x}}-\frac{3\sqrt{2}q}{4\pi\varepsilon_o L^2}\bold{\hat{y}}}$$

  \item A uniformly charged rod of length $L$ and charge $q$ is placed along the $x$-axis with its center at $x=a$. Find the $x$-component of the electric field at a point on the $z$ axis. (Hint: use $R$ as the variable of integration.) Check your expression in the following limit: $z=0$ and $a>>L$.

        \label{fig:2}
      \end{figure}
    \end{center}
    
  \item Calculate the electric potential on the $z$-axis due to a uniformly charged annulus in the $xy$-plane centered at the origin with inner radius $a$ and outer radius $b$. Then find the electric field from the gradient of the potential.
    
  \item Consider an infinitely long uniformly-charged solid cylinder of radius $a$ and charge per unit volume $\rho$ surrounded by a coaxial cylindrical shell of radius $b$ and charge per unit area of $\sigma$. Take the axis of the cylinders as the $z$-axis.

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item Calculate the electric field everywhere in space

      \item Also calculate the potential as a function of the distance from the axis, taking the potential to be zero on the $z$-axis.

    \end{enumerate}
    
  \item The electric field for two charged concentric spherical shells is given by

    $$\left\{\begin{array}{c c} 0, & r<a\\ \bold{\hat{r}}A_1/r^2, & a< r< b\\ \bold{\hat{r}}A_2/r^2, & r>b \end{array}$$

      Where $A_1=5\times 10^6\left[ \frac{\si{\newton\meter\squared}}{\si{\coulomb}} \right]$, $A_2=-3\times10^6\left[ \frac{\si{\newton\meter\squared}}{\si{\coulomb}} \right]$, $a=.25[\si{\meter}]$, and $b=.45[\si{\meter}]$. Find the surface charge densities $\sigma_a$ and $\sigma_b$ on the two shells.
    
\end{enumerate}
