  \item Current
    
    \begin{itemize}

      \item Ohm's ``Law''\footnote{Note: this is not a fundamental law}

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Holds when there is some current density such that $\vec{J}=\sigma\vec{E}$, with $\sigma$ as conductivity

          \item The unit of conductivity is $\left[ \frac{\si{\ampere}}{\si{\volt\meter}} \right]$

          \item The resistivity is the inverse of the conductivity, $\rho=\sigma^{-1}$, with units $\left[ \si{\ohm\meter} \right]$\footnote{Note: Ohms are equal to $\frac{\si{\volt}}{\si{\ampere}}$}

        \end{itemize}

      \item The average velocity of a particle accelerated over an interval due to an electric field is:

        $$v_{avg}=\sqrt{\frac{q\vec{E}d}{2m}}$$

      \item The current density can be defined as

        $$\vec{J}=nq\vec{v}$$

      \item An electron's drift velocity may be defined as:

        $$v_d=\frac{1}{2}\frac{q\vec{E}d}{mv}$$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item As long as $v_d<<v$

        \end{itemize}

      \item Given a wire of length $L$ and potential $V_o$, we can calculate:

        $$\vec{E}=\frac{V_o}{L}$$
        $$R=\frac{V}{I}=\frac{\vec{E}L}{\vec{J}A}=\frac{\rho L}{A}$$

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
