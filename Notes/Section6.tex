  \item Torque on a Dipole

    $$\vec{N}=\vec{m}\times\vec{B}$$

    \begin{itemize}

      \item This is akin to the torque on an electric dipole:

        $$\vec{N}=\vec{p}\times\vec{E}$$

      \item We can calculate the torque to be:

        $$\vec{N}=m\vec{B}\sin(\theta)$$

      \item The energy can be defined as:

        $$U=-\vec{m}\cdot\vec{B}$$

      \item The bound bulk and surface currents can be defined as:

        $$\vec{J}_b=\vec{\nabla}\times\vec{M}\quad\text{ and }\quad\vec{K}_b=\vec{M}\times\bold{\hat{n}}$$

      \item For a uniform magnetized sphere:

        $$\vec{J}_b=0\quad\text{ and }\quad\vec{K}_b=M\sin(\theta)\hat{\phi}$$

      \item

        $$\vec{A}(r)=\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\int\frac{\vec{J}_b}{R}\,d\tau+\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\int\frac{\vec{K}_b}{R}\,da$$

    \end{itemize}

  \item Auxiliary Field ($\vec{H}$)

    $$\vec{H}=\frac{1}{\mu_o}\vec{B}-\vec{M}\Rightarrow \vec{B}=\mu(\vec{H}+\vec{M})$$

    \begin{itemize}

      \item From this formula, we can get:

        $$\vec{\nabla}\times\vec{H}=\frac{\vec{\nabla}\times\vec{B}}{\mu_o}-\vec{\nabla}\times\vec{M}$$

      \item Which can become:

        $$\vec{\nabla}\times\vec{H}=\vec{J}-\vec{J}_b=\vec{J}_F$$

    \end{itemize}

  \item Linear Materials

    $$\vec{M}=\chi_m\vec{H}$$

    \begin{itemize}

      \item This is not quite the same as the $\vec{E}$ case, where $\vec{p}=\varepsilon_o\chi_e\vec{E}$


        $$\vec{B}=\mu_o(\vec{H}+\vec{M})=\mu_o(1+\chi_m)\vec{H}$$
        $$\mu=\mu_o(1+\chi_m)$$

      \item Unlike dielectrics, $\chi_m$ could be either positive or negative
    \end{itemize}
